    "A __correlation__ is a _statistical relationship_ between two variables. If we wanted to know _if vaccines work_, we might look at the correlation between the use of the vaccine and whether it results in prevention of the infection or disease. In this task, you are to see if there is a correlation between _having had the chicken pox_ and the _number of chickenpox vaccine doses given_ (varicella).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes on interpreting the answer. The `had_chickenpox_column` is either $1$ (for _yes_) or $2$ (for _no_), and the `num_chickenpox_vaccine_column` is the number of doses a child has been given of the varicella vaccine. A _positive correlation_ (e.g., $corr > 0$) means that an increase in _had\\_chickenpox\\_column_ (which means more _no_’s) would also increase the values of _num\\_chickenpox\\_vaccine\\_column_ (which means _more doses of vaccine_). If there is a _negative correlation_ (e.g., $corr < 0$), it indicates that having had chickenpox is related to an increase in the number of vaccine doses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, $pval$ is the probability that we observe a correlation between _had\\_chickenpox\\_column_ and _num\\_chickenpox\\_vaccine\\_column_ which is greater than or equal to a particular value occurred by chance. A _small pval_ means that the observed correlation is highly unlikely to occur by chance. In this case, _pval_ should be very small (will end in $e-18$ indicating a very small number)."
